//! # Thin Collections for Rust
//! Alternative implementations for vector, map and set that are faster/smaller for some use cases.
//!
//! `ThinVec` is a general vector replacement that only uses a single `usize`.
//! `std::collections::Vec` uses 3. This makes `ThinVec` a much better choice when it's used
//! inside another data structure, such as a vector of vectors or a map of vectors, etc.
//!
//! `ThinMap` is a specialized map replacement for small key values. It uses less memory than `HashMap`
//! if `mem::size_of::<(K, V)>() < 18`. It's also 2x to 5x faster (see the benchmarks). It's perfect
//! for all the primitives, or your own keys, but for custom keys, you must implement the `ThinSentinel`
//! trait.
//!
//! `ThinSet` uses `ThinMap` underneath, so it's great for elements up to 18 bytes.
//!
//! `V64` is a specialized vector replacement that uses a single 64bit value to represent itself.
//! It can store up to 7 bytes in that, and then uses heap memory. It's ideal for small vectors,
//! especially if those vectors are used inside other data structures.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! thincollections = "0.5.0"
//! ```
//!
//! and this to your crate root:
//!
//! ```rust
//! #[macro_use] extern crate thincollections;
//! # fn main() {
//! # }
//! ```
//!
